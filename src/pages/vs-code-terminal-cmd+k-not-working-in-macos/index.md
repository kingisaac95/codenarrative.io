> Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is awesome ðŸ˜Ž Now that Iâ€™ve said that, welcome! ðŸ˜€

If like me youâ€™ve gotten into the habit of clearing your terminal using the `Cmd+K` shortcut, it becomes a pain when you canâ€™t do that in VS Code.

Before today, Iâ€™d re-configure the key mapping to something like `Cmd+Shift+Delete` but that never for once felt natural. Setting up my new MacBook today, I decided that Iâ€™d figure out a way to fix that.

After googling, reading related issues on github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues, and running into different stackoverflow answers, I found something that works.

Here it is!

1. Launch visual studio code and go `Code > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts`.
2. Click the icon in the top right corner that says `Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)`
3. Then add the following lines to the array

```json
{
  "key": "Cmd+K",
  "command": "workbench.action.terminal.clear"
}
```

Note: If you want the key binding to work only when youâ€™re in the terminal (for cases where you have same key binding for other actions), you can add the following line to that object

```json
{
  "key": "Cmd+K",
  "command": "workbench.action.terminal.clear"
  "when": "terminalFocus"// highlight-line
}
```

> Problem solved! ðŸŽ‰
